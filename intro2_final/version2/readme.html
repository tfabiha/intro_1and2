    <p>As of right now, users can log in to our webiste in the <a href="http://clyde.stuy.edu/~tfabiha/finalproject/version2/home.py?UserEmail=mybae&magicNumber=704408">homepage</a>. After they have authenticated, they can make posts int eh homepage and view posts from other users. They can also roleplay in the chat. In this chat, users can choose existing chats or create a new one, and choose between two characters. Additionally, users can navigate to the account page where they can view the "Me" page. In this page, they are able to set their avatar picture, change their password, change their info, and make a post. Users can also go to the "About" page to see info about the team that made the page.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Our future goals are to make the quiz, format the roleplay chat, create the backstory, format the posts properly, create the rest of the avatars, and allow users to fill in their information in the "Me" page.</p>
    <br>
    <h1>Bugs</h1>
    The formatting for some of the pages are messed up. Users aren't able to see the "About" page after they have logged in, but can see it when they aren't logged in. Also, users are able to name the chat more than one word, which is not supposed to be the case.
