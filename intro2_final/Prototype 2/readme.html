<h2>Features</h2>
    <p>Our website is Zompirates, which is a combination of Zombies and Pirates. After a user has logged in
they can make posts in the homepage and view posts other users have made.They can also take the quiz to 
find out if they are more zombie or pirate. The Roleplay page allows them to create a new chat or join an 
existing chat. In this chat, they choose what characters they wish to be for roleplay. They have the option 
of adding another user to the chat, adding another character, and removing a character(cannot be done if 
there are only two characters. In the About page, users can view the Team behind Zompirates and the backstory
of how it came to be. In the Account Page, users have the option of choosing an avatar picture, making posts 
on their proifle, changing their information, and changing their password. From the account page, they can
navigate to the World page. This shows them all the users on the site, and lets them go to the user's profile.<p>

<h2>Bugs</h2>
<p>For some reason, the buttons in our website are insanely glitchy, that's why you can see missing buttons in
some places. In the changing passwords page, there is no button to hit when u submit because its disappeared into
the deep ends of spacetime, but you can still hit enter to submit the form so we didn't bother trying to fix it. 
(We didn't have any time to do it either.) Sometimes the buttons glitched and led to the completely wrong pages too
and we're pretty sure that we've fixed the issue, but we could be wrong. We apologies for any other bugs that we've
missed. Our sleep addled minds can't remember anything else.</p>
