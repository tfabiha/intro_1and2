	Currently you can create a new chat to roleplay in. In the chat creation site you can pick a name and two characters<br>
	that you wish to roleplay as. After you have successfully managed to create a chat, you will be taken to the existing<br>
	chats. You will be given a list of all the chats and you can choose the one that you wish to see. You will then be taken<br>
	to the actual chat where you can add things to the chat.<br>

	We don't have a majority of our website working yet. Especially our theme. But we were preoccupied with making our roleplay<br>
	feature run.
