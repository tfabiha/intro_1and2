            <p>I'm a huge anime nerd, or geek or whatever. But I wouldn't say I'm completely opposed to cartoons. Though  I do have an insanely short list of cartoons that I've actually watched and liked. And they are, dun, dun, dun...</p>
            <ol>
                <li>ATLA</li>
                <li>VLD</li>
                <li>LOK</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Tbh the third one is only there 'cause I found out that korrasami is canon. It's the purest ship ever. :)</p>

        <div>
            <p>I didn't think that VLD would really be my thing. I mean big robot space cats defending the universe from an terrorizing invader, yeah no. But, I really do like meta theories. And VLD is the perfect show to theorise about. Who knows what's going to happen next. I mean honestly they have space cats okay, anything could happen. ANYTHING! and yes i am one of those terrible tumblr ppl ok</p>

                <p>&lt;= Okay so this is Lance. People characterize him as self-obsessed, selfish, overconfident, etc. But he's actually not though??? He's literally the exact opposite of all of these adjectives.</p>
                
                <p>Proof of some of the heroic and noble things he's done because I'm salty af:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Jumped in front of a guy that he barely knows to protect him from a bomb. Ends up in a coma. :(</li>
                    <li>Was in a coma for an entire episode, but when his teammates needed him, he woke up just to blast the bad guy with his gun and passed out again.</li>
                    <li>Made a random alien friend and procceded to boast about how amazing his friends were while calling himself useless.</li>
                    <li>Downplayed his own heroic actions as if they didn't matter.</li>
                    <li>Was completely shocked when ppl called him a hero.</li>
                    <li>His dreams are to be recognized as an asset to his team.</li>
                    <li>Tries his best to help his teammates cheer up even if it means making a fool of himself.</li>
                    <li>There's way more honestly...</li>
